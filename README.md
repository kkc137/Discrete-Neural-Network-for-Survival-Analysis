# Discrete Time Neural Survival (DTNS) Models

This library provides an implementation of Discrete Time Neural Survival (DTNS) models using PyTorch. It is designed to facilitate research and development in the field of survival analysis, particularly where discrete time models are applicable.

## Features

- **Discrete Time Neural Network**: Implements an encoder with customizable layers, optional activation functions, and a softmax output layer to model survival probabilities across discrete time bins.
- **Loss Functions**: Includes implementations of Negative Log-Likelihood Loss (NLL) and Cross-Entropy Loss (CEL) specifically tailored for survival analysis.
- **Utility Functions**: Additional helper functions for batch creation and evaluation metrics like the Concordance Index.

## Installation

To use this library, you will need Python 3.6 or later and PyTorch. You can install the required packages with pip:

```bash
pip install numpy torch
